# Golang

- Go is a statically/strictly typed language that also often feels dynamically typed sometimes.

- Package main is for executable. Package main must contain declaration of a main func 
func main() {

}

# declaring a variable:
var <variableName> <dataType> = value
e.g:
var name string = "zohaib"
var i int = 100
var b bool = false
var f float64 = 77.90
